This repository contains a simple Julia function demonstrating how to handle errors effectively.  The initial function throws an error when a negative number is input, showcasing Julia's built-in error handling capabilities. A more robust error handling is implemented in the `bugSolution.jl` file, offering a more sophisticated solution. This example highlights how to handle different input scenarios and create user-friendly error messages.
